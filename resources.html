      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>There's so many resources out there, and many of them are totally <strong>free!</strong> Here I'll write some additional information on how I've used them, or what I have gathered about these different resources. Enjoy!</p>
      <ul class="resource-info">
        <li>
          <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com"> Treehouse:</a> This is maby the best organized and rich platform I have used for learning to code so far. I have used them over several years(on and of), and I have used it mainly for Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript. But I have also taken lessons on stuff like WordPress, Git, Development Tools and Digital Literacy. They have a large library with courses, workshops and practices, but also offer a variety of "tracks" like "Front End Development" or "Web Design" where the recomended courses are laid out for you. Their most expensive option is the "Treehouse TechDegree", where you learn along other tech degree students and do projects to fill your portfolio in pace with your knowledge. It's a community at the basic and pro plan as well, but they're stepping it up with a dedicated slack channel for the TechDegree students and teachers. Here you can ask questions and get answers shortly, ask students and teachers to review you projects(and review others!), so it's a big bonus if you ask me.<br>
          <span>Pricing monthly: Basic:$25/Pro:$49/Techdegree:$199.</span>

          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Sololearn:</a> Free courses in many of the popular programming languages. There's code playground where you can play around with what you just learned. They got an app, wich is great for learning on the go. I have used this in between my other courses when I don't have access to my computer. Great way for a intro and to brush up on skills, but you'll need to do more than just going through the courses to get the real life experience. I have personally experienced a bit of bugging in their quizes where the app hangs, but hey, it's free!<br>

It's also a great place to look up things if you want to read up on the syntax you are learning. Searching for i.e. 'functions' will yield a result of different documents on the matter.<br>
