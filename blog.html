        <p>I find it necessary to have a seperate project to work on along my learning. So as I follow along with the instructions on whatever learning platform I use at the moment, I will parallelly build my own project. At this moment, that project is this page, because I'm learning HTML and CSS. This means that my page will have all kinds of weird choices thrown in, like cheesy text-shadowing and pictures even if I don't want it to be a part of my page in the "end". This is because I feel that I should try all the different techniques on another project, where I'm not copying the instructor word for word. </p>
        <p>So far I have learned a lot from this, because it's not always working as I want it to, and I have to understand <em>why not</em>, and fix it. I also find that I want some different features that I haven't learned yet, and have to google and find stuff myself. It's been very rewarding!</p>

          <h3>Lost opportunity</h3>
          <p>19.03.19</p>
        </header>
        <p>Bah...today I was called back from, what I belive to be, Norways first boot camp for coders. I had taken an IQ and personality test online a couple of weeks ago, and was picked to be involved in the next round. I had to send them my CV, application and a motivation letter.</p>
        <p>Today they called and asked if I still was interessted in the "camp". Thing is, it wasn't just the three months of learning, but I had to stay in Oslo for a year working (getting paid) for their clients after the camp was over.</p>
        <p>This is a great opportunity, and free of charge! Thing is, I have three kids, a boyfriend and a job. I could have <em>maby</em> managed to scrape together a plan to do the three months since I'm on unpaid maternity leave until august. But a <em>year</em>...bah..</p>

          <h3>Make a cheat sheet!</h3>
          <p>19.03.19</p>
        </header>
        <p>I recently came up whit the idea to make myself a cheat sheet. Yes, there is a lot of ready made cheat sheets out there, and yes, I can google stuff as I have recomended you to do. But I wanted to make a reference document whit the stuff I'm practicing right now.</p>
        <p>And do you know what? I'm learning a ton! I've always learned better when taking notes, but just taking notes doesn't make it stick. I mean, I do follow the instructors on the online courses I take, so I do nothing <em>else</em> but writing down the stuff they say I should. BUT, that doesn't mean I understand what I'm doing. 
        <p>As english is not my first language I wrote a cheat sheet in norwegian. When writing an explentaion for a element, tag or a container, I really have to understand what it does. This might be an even better method for those of you who are bilingual, but I feel like this could be a great trick for everyone.</p>
        <p>I got my sister into learing code with me(wohoo!), and she felt like it helped her a lot as well!</p>
        <p>Give it a try and tell me if it helpes. </p>

          <h3>Google it!</h3>
          <p>16.03.19</p>
        </header>
        <p>There is no shame in googling stuff. It's typically what you would do when looking for answers to stuff you don't know, isn't it?</p>
        <p>It's great to find out if a language can do the stuff you want it to do, or to refresh knowledge. It's all about discovering new stuff and relearn until it sticks. And I guess that in most languages, you can't possibly contain all the information in your head at all times, even if you have beeen coding for years. </p>
        <p>I often pause my video lessons and try to figure out stuff for my self first. I google it, trying to implement it in my project, and then go back to the lesson. I feel like I learn more this way, as I am sort of familiar with it already when the lesson comes around, and can soak up all the additional information and not just the gist of it.</p>
        <p>I feel like this is commonly mentioned by professionals as well, so google away and learn awesome stuff!</p>

          <h3>Podcasts people!</h3>
          <p>14.03.19</p>
        </header>
        <p>If you haven't already, find them podcasts! Don't wait, just do it. I have listened for a few weeks now and I firmly believe that being exposed to podcasts has helped me a great deal as a newbie. Do I always understand all the lingo, the technical terms and whatnot? Um, no! But I've learned heaps from them, and if I revisit them(as I sometimes do) I suddenly understand a lot more than the first time, since I've been learning and practicing in the meantime. Read more about why you should start listening and what podcasts I listen to <a href="podcasts.html">here</a></p>

          <h3>Finding my path, for now</h3>
          <p>13.03.19</p>
        </header>
        <p>After reading up on different coding languages and some of the seemingly millions of paths you can take when working in code, I've decided what to do for now. If I want to make a website to share and my journey, and maybe one day my portfolio, it really can't hurt to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript (at the very least the first two). "Everybody" who wants to share content on the web need someone capable in these languages, and I want to share myself, so why not. I also hear and read about the somewhat common syntax in many languages that makes it easier to pick up skills when you already know one. When I feel confident enough with my basic skills in this triad I plan to revisit Python to see what I feel about that now. Is it a smart choice? I have absolutely no idea, but I will keep you posted!</p>

        <p> So, as mentioned I love to try new things, and tend to get a bit carried away. Where does that leave me when I want to transition into tech? I can't just choose what appeals to me the most(I don't even know what that is, it's all so intriguing to me), but I want to choose something that may have the possibility to get me somewhere. So for a person with no tech-skills on her diploma, what is the best skill to learn to have a chance to get a tech-job? </p>
        <p>As you can read more about in my <a href="podcasts.html">podcast</a> post, I learn a lot from them. They talk about skills, opportunities and types of jobs. Thing is, I don't live in the US and can't take their advice blindly without knowing the need for these skills is existent in my country. Also, some of the episodes dates years back, and stuff seem to move fast in the tech world.</p>
        <p>But, after googling around a bit, I found an Norwegian article with a vote of what people thought was the most needed programming language in the future. Javascript, C# and C/C++ was at the top with Python as the runner up. I'm at bit concerned at this point since HTML and CSS is not even on the list(of like 15 other languages), and here I was thinking I HAD to learn both HTML and CSS if wanted to make a webpage or an app in any shape or form? After some research I gathered this list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML</strong> - <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i>.<br> For detailing the layouts of webpages. All webpages has HTML as their <strong>scaffolding</strong> that contains the content of a page. HTML isn't a programming language pr definition. It is a <strong>markup</strong> language and has no programming logic. So, guess that one is still important then..phew.</li>
          <li><strong>CSS</strong> - <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i> <br>- A way to make padding on the HTML scaffolding in the form of styling the look of it, or the <strong>presentation</strong>. Put simply: The HTML makes the page, and CSS makes it pretty. After googling my butt of, I can't really find that there are any real options. So I guess this one is still very relevant to know as well(if you want to be able to make a webpage look OK )</li>
          <li><strong
            >Javascript</strong> - A method to make the webpages more interactive and making dynamic content. It's the <strong>behavior</strong> layer of a web page. This meaning that the content on the page can change without loading a new page like with just using HTML and CSS. Commonly used for stuff like slideshows and auto complete-suggestions.</li>

        </header>
        <p>It all started about 6-7 years ago. My SO has a PHD in mathematics and have used his fair share of <strong>Python</strong>. I understood nada of all that at the time, brushing it of as stuff for super smart people. But him making programs to find useful words in scrabble, and making a program to single out names with our specifics when waiting on our first baby, was nothing less than magic to me! I downloaded an app and began learning Python and ran through some free classes and quizzes, all on my phone.</p>
        <p> Skip a few years forward and I was once again drawn to coding after he got a new job and talked about things he did with code. I signed up on Treehouse, went through enough Python to make a tiny game, and a tutorial to make a webpage with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. Then I kind of hit a wall. I wanted to learn more, but what practical use could this ever have for me? Isn't it better to spend my time on a productive hobby? So, long story a bit shorter, I saw no viable path forward, and let it go.</p>
        <p>I really love to learn a new skill, always have, but it has to have some sort of (even imaginary) goal. This time around I feel like I can imagine the possibilities on a whole other level. I don't have to have a career lined up, (even though I think I would love to transition into tech) but I can see that skills obtained are not useless even if I just want to keep on dabbling on my own. Now I'm kicking myself for not sticking with it when my life was a bit calmer, because at 33 I feel like I kinda glued to my career path, but I don't want to be. </p>
